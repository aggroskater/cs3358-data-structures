Second exam will have postfix evaluation expression. Show work like the 
handout does.

3A due two weeks from today (next next wednesday). 3B is optional extra credit.

3A and 3B overdue at this point (along with 2A and 2B). I prefer to do these things thoroughly, and not just get my 100 for making the output look right.

Project 4 is binary search and recursion.

Project 5 is quicksort.

Project 6 is towers of hanoi with recursion.

TEST TWO: Will happen next week (Mon Apr 8 or Wed Apr 10, date not yet given). 
Test two will probably emphasize vectors over other containers. Probably won't 
include associative containers (like set,map,multiset,multimap).

Test two ended up being a week later.

TEST THREE: This coming Monday (April 29 2013) and will be over binary search 
trees and hashing. Reviewed binary trees this past monday (April 22 2013) and 
I'm assuming we'll review hashes today (April 24 2013). Be familiar with the 
three deletion cases. BSTs are very nice wrt searching. DELETION WILL BE ON 
THE EXAM.

FINAL: May 8 2013 2PM. MCS-590. Bounded copy of all previous assignments. 
Handed out a guideline. Said something about a demo. Demo will be:

-Bring laptop with your code for each assignment.
-You will show that each lab compiles and runs, while professor looks at any 
 output.
