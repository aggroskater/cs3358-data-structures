Second exam will have postfix evaluation expression. Show work like the 
handout does.

3A due two weeks from today (next next wednesday). 3B is optional extra credit.

3A and 3B overdue at this point (along with 2A and 2B). I prefer to do these things thoroughly, and not just get my 100 for making the output look right.

Project 4 is binary search and recursion.

GOD DAMMIT. I broke the build -__-. I'm guessing I didn't actually add my 
stack_ll implementation to the repo via git add -__- FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!
