Second exam will have postfix evaluation expression. Show work like the 
handout does.

First exam this coming monday.

3A due two weeks from today (next next wednesday). 3B is optional extra credit.

Exam is: 4-6 problems. Might ask you to write a function, evaluate code. 
Especially pointers and memory content at various points. Know aspects of 
OOP (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation). Don't give more sentences in 
your answer than he asks for. Will probably have a diagram question detailing 
memory. Wants you to evaluate some code and then draw a new diagram.
