Homework assignments for data structures class at Texas State University.
Professor requires use of C++ or Java. I'd prefer to use C so that I can learn 
it simultaneously, but specs are specs. Each lab assignment's focus is held in 
respective folders. Linked list implementation is in lab1, stacks in lab2, 
queues in lab3, binary searches in lab4, etc. Common objects are held in the 
root directory (the Student objects, for example). I may end up tagging 
compilable commits that you can then download and check for the state of the 
work at the time the lab was done, as much of my later work modified the 
linked list code to serve the functions of stacks and queues later on.
