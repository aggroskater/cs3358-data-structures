Deleted lab3 branch again. Only had ramblings and didnt have the stack_ll 
changes in the FF when I did git pull origin lab3 , since I added those 
AFTER the latest commit I had for lab3 locally. Nothing of value was lost.

I'm starting to notice how sometimes, I'll end up "merging" changes from one 
computer I was working on into another. This makes the gitk look messy, 
because it appears there are multiple contributors to the repo. In a sense, I 
suppose that's correct. But it still looks ugly.
