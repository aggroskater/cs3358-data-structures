# About

This lab was designed to utilize recursion in solving the Towers of Hanoi 
puzzle. I borrowed the rendering engine from one of my previous CS class 
projects, `cardgame`. You can find the relevant source code 
[here](https://github.com/aggroskater/cardgame/blob/master/A01234567_AcesUp.cpp)
. That said, the rendering here seems to be adding unneeded newlines. However, 
the program is still following the Towers of Hanoi rules.

# Compilation and running

    $ g++ main.cpp -o toh
    $ ./toh
